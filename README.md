# millihex_test

Initial test version of millihex_robot.

This project is an initial conception for a bio-inspired Millihexapod stick-insect robot.
This package is meant to be used within ROS and Gazebo in a Docker image to allow easy, cross-platform sharing and development.
This project has been transferred to a newer version (millihex_robot) in which a Dockerfile will automate Docker image creation with ROS and Gazebo.
